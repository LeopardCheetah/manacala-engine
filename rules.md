Player B's Bank =>      ( ) {} {} {} {} {} {} ( )
                        ( ) {} {} {} {} {} {} ( )     <= Player A's Bank

                                    /\
                                    ||
                              Player A's Side


Holes are marked with curly brackets {}, and the bank is marked by a set of two parentheses.

## Setup

1. Gather 48 pebbles and one playing board
2. Put 4 pebbles into each hole of the playing board
3. Decide who goes first

## Gameplay
1. One player will choose a hole from their side that contains 1 or more pebbles. 
> If on a player's turn all the holes on their side are empty, they are allowed to move pebbles from the opposing side.

2. That player will then move in a counterclockwise fashion around the board placing one pebble into each hole that is encountered along the way. 
3. If a player reaches their own bank, they will deposit one pebble inside their own bank and continue moving in a counterclockwise fashion.
4. If a player reaches the other player's bank, they will skip the other person's bank and continue moving in a counterclockwise fashion.
5. If a player's last pebble is placed into an empty hole, their turn ends.
6. If a player's last pebble is placed into a hole that is not empty, they will place their pebble into that hole, then pick up all the marbles in that hole and continue moving in a counter-clockwise direction.
7. If a player's last pebble ends in their bank, they get to go again.


#### Example:

If player A starts their turn by picking the pebbles up from hole P, then the first pebble would be placed in hole 1, the second in hole 2, etc.
```


                        ( ) {12} {11} {10} {9} {8} {7} (6)
                        ( ) {P } {1 } {2 } {3} {4} {5} ( )
